# Python-C-SciComputing

This repository contains code written and utilized during a graduate course in High-Performance scientific computing at the University of Washington in Spring of 2016. The course was hosted on github and code was written in Python/C and utilized open source tools such as OpenMP and MPI to implement optimized parallel computational routines. The purpose of this repository is to provide a small showcase of my ability to write code in the Python and C languages.
## Summary of projects
Within each `assignment'_'` folder the `README.md` document contains the *original rubric* of the assignment with a detailed description of the files and expectations. 

In addition to writing code, each `assignment'_'` folder contains a `report` folder with a writeup on some of the results along with particular visualizations and answers to various questions.

* Assignment 1 - Wrote code to implement and visualize the Collatz conjecture, perform gradient descent, and iteratively solve matrix equations via the Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel methods. 
* Assignment 2 - Implemented common linear algebra routines in C.
* Assignment 3 - Used OpenMP to numerically calculate integrals using the trapezoidal/simpson rule algorithms in parallel. 
* Assignment 4 - Wrote code to solve the heat-equation with a MPI methodology.
