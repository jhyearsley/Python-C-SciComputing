# Python-Code

This repository contains code written during a graduate course in High-Performance scientific computing at the University of Washington in Spring of 2016.

##Summary of projects
* Assignment 1 - Wrote code to implement and visualize the Collatz conjecture, perform gradient descent, and iteratively solve matrix equations via the Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel methods. 
* Assignment 2 - Implemented common linear algebra routines in C, which were then wrapped in Python code.
* Assignment 3 - Used OpenMP to numerically calculate integrals using the trapezoidal/simpson rule algorithms in parallel. 
* Assignment 4 - Wrote code to solve the heat-equation with a MPI methodology.
