# Python-Code

This repository contains code written and utilized during a graduate course in High-Performance scientific computing at the University of Washington in Spring of 2016. The course was hosted on github and code was written in Python/C and utilized open source tools such as OpenMP and MPI to implement optimized parallel computational routines. The purpose of this repository is to provide a small showcase of some projects I have worked on with the Python and C languages.
##Summary of projects
Within each `assignment '_'` folder the 'README.md' document contains the original rubric of the assignment with a detailed description of the files and expectations. Note that some of the code within each folder was provided by the course instructor and then utilized to solve specific problems (it is explicitly stated in the assignment rubric which code was provided).  
* Assignment 1 - Wrote code to implement and visualize the Collatz conjecture, perform gradient descent, and iteratively solve matrix equations via the Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel methods. 
* Assignment 2 - Implemented common linear algebra routines in C.
* Assignment 3 - Used OpenMP to numerically calculate integrals using the trapezoidal/simpson rule algorithms in parallel. 
* Assignment 4 - Wrote code to solve the heat-equation with a MPI methodology.
