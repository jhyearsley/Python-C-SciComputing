# Homework 1

The first homework assignment will be written entirely in Python. It will serve,
in part, as practice for submitting homework using git and GitHub as well as a
test of your Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib knowledge and your general
programming abilities.

Please see the document "`Grading.md`" on the course website for instructions on
how to write and submit your homework. This repository should have the name

`homework1_githubusername`

and should be labeled as "private". (Visible by yourself and the instructors and
teaching assistants, only.) **Do not manually fork the repository
`uwhpsc-2016/homework1`**. Instead, *follow the link sent to you via email to
obtain your private copy / fork of this repo*.

Recall that there are four main components that you will be graded on:

* Will your code pass the automated tests described in the exercises?
* Do you have a well-written report for the exercises marked "**Report**"? Place
  the report in the subdirectory `homework1/report/` as a file names
  `report.pdf`.
* Is your code well-documented according to the rubric?
* Does your code perform well for the questions marked "**Performance**"? (Note
  that none of the questions in the first homework assignment will be tested for
  performance.)

Do not forget to commit and push your changes to your private repository.
